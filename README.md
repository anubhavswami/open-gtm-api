# âš¡ Open GTM API

This is the backend API for the **Open GTM Strategy Service** â€” a tool that helps early-stage startups determine the most suitable Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy based on a short questionnaire.

Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for speed, flexibility, and ease of integration with the React frontend (`open-gtm-ui`).

---

## ðŸ§© What This Does

- Accepts GTM-related questionnaire responses via POST request
- Maps inputs to a GTM strategy (e.g. Sales-led, PLG, Community-led)
- Returns a simple JSON response
- Includes CORS setup for integration with frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
